# Monster VS Towers

![screenshot](https://www.zupimages.net/up/23/11/q188.png)
This is my second student project on Unity, a 3D Multiplayer Tower Defense, made in 2021. 
In this game, an attacker will send troops with the keyboard, while the defender will place turrets along the path using the mouse. This game ends when the defender survived a certain amount of waves or time, or when his health reaches zero.

## Gameplay 
You can find [here](https://youtu.be/GOqG-ffCF8c) a gameplay of this game.
## Team
We were a team of three people on this project : 
 - Driss Cherif, who created the menu and chose most of the UI assets 
  - Joseph Thibault, who mostly worked on level-desigining, money system, ...
  - Myself, who mostly worked on gameplay : turrets placement, behaviors (aiming, firing with raycasts), and enemy behaviors.
